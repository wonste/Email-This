#### Use beautiful soup and pandas
#### So what we want is a way to extract a measurement of a unit and the user can highlight it and it will return the unit converted - either from 
#### imperial to metric or metric to imperial. 
#### Step 1 is to highlight the text - > the browser extension will parse this text, i believe by using beautiful soup
#### The text is saved? by beautiful soup and will need to be converted to the alternative. So in order to do that, 
#### we need to determine if the unit we received was in metric or imperial units. 
#### Then we need to convert that unit that was highlighted. We can use the pandas library for this. 
#### So now we have a converted unit. Our browser app should populate the most recent data that we converted from our pandas library
##### **Ancillary but cool** figure out how to have the conversion appear when you right click****
